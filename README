## Functionality

### Homepage (index.html)
The homepage serves as an introductory page for the E-Commerce website, offering links to various product categories such as electronics, beauty, clothes, and more. The main purpose is to allow users to quickly navigate to the category they are interested in.

### Product Category Pages (accessories.html, beauty.html, books.html, etc.)
Each product category page is dedicated to displaying products from a specific category. These pages provide a list or grid of products with images, descriptions, and prices. The user can explore the items within that category.

### Navigation
The navigation bar provides links to the homepage and all the product categories, making it easy for users to switch between different sections of the site.

### Responsiveness
The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring that the layout adapts to various screen sizes, including mobile devices and tablets.

### Styling
All pages share a common stylesheet (styles.css), ensuring consistent visual design across the website. The use of colors, spacing, and typography is intended to enhance the user experience while browsing the site.
